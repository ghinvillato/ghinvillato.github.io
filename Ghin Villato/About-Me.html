          <span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Hello! I am, Ginalyn Villato. I'm from Philippines currently in UAE, I have not finished any college degree yet. If you are wondering why I didn't finish any degree I will give you a brief explanation why. When I was young, I'm always wondering about everything. And that wonder will cause me fear about trying everything, I see myself as a weak person that time. I can't try nothing at all, I can't finish anything because of my fear. I don't know what fear's me at that time, I can't understand myself. <br>That's why when I get in my mature age, I realized that I lost too much time because of my fears. The fear that I can't even understand where it's coming from. After realizing the time wasted in my life, I get up on my own, I tried to live independently, I face my fears hoping to overcome it. And yes, there is always hope in everything, I overcame my fears. I stopped doubting myself, but I never stop wondering about everything. <br>
            <br>And now, I am still wondering what fits on me. I tried a lot of new experiences to explore everything, I'd like to try everything now. My fear's to myself is gone. I trust myself now more than anyone, I'm willing to learn everything that can help me grow as an individual. <br>
            <br>That's why one day I decided to go to a book fair in Expo Centre Sharjah to explore something there. And there I saw the booth of House Of Wisdom, they introduce me about FabLab. Since then I started wondering about FabLab, and the day came that I finally inquired about having a workshop to their lab. And now I am here introducing myself to you, as one of a student of Fab Academy. Experiencing FabLab is a wonderful experience, and I will take that experience in the future.&nbsp;
